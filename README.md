# NYPD-Stop-and-Frisk-Data-Analysis
 
 The New York Police Department’s Stop-and-Frisk policy was a controversial strategy to stop “suspicious” individuals and check for weapons or contraband. In 1999, African American and Latino individuals were detained in 84% of the total stops, but they only made up 50% of New York City’s population [1]. Weapons and contraband were found much more often on white individuals than black people. According to article one, weapons were half as likely to be found on black people. Contraband, such as illicit drugs or drug paraphernalia, was one third as likely to be found on black individuals than white people. A federal judge named Shira Scheindlin deemed the policy unconstitutional and claimed that it conflicted with the fourth amendment, which prevents excessive searches and seizures. According to article two, the policy operated between 1994 and 2013 under two mayors. Mayor Rudy Giuliana was in office from 1994 to 2001. Then, Mayor Michael Bloomberg was in office from 2002 to 2013. The end of the policy was close to ten years ago. This was not a policy from the 1950s or 1960s. It was modern systemic racism under the guise of a New York Police Department policy. Even though the policy was found to be unconstitutional, our group wants to analyse the data for ourselves and make our own conclusions. We look forward to analysing the data and determining whether certain races or genders were targeted more than others. Please find the specifics of our proposal below. Additionally, taking incidents into consideration the department was disregarded and mentioned distrustful. Media has played a main part in overshadowing the face of the NYPD and charging them of assault, guilty of attacking with physical force and of wrong suspect, sometimes, they are also portrayed as “murderers”. In recent years, not only NYPD but police departments of different other states have been in the limelight and it’s making a negative impact on citizens and the media is making that worse. Moreover, it’s ironic to say that having available for the security of the entire state/ city/ town the negative portrayal of the department has been demoralising.
 
 Questions from the dataset:
1. Do certain races get stopped, frisked, or arrested more?
2. Are there more arrests according to precinct?
3. Did the stop and frisk policy reduce crimes in New York City during these years?
4. What could be the major possible reasons behind these stoppings?
5. Is the policy really working as it should be?
6. Can we predict the frisking ratio and classify it as High or Low frisking ratio based on certain groupings?

Lets get into more details in the R code script to explore this Stop and Frisk data and uncover some new findings.
